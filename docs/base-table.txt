# one line of the table consists of the following information
# column 1 : card
# column 2 : response (bitmap to be clicked 1 to 4)
# colomn 3 : response in previous task (or 0 if no previous task)
# column 4 : trial number in a task sequence, 1 is first, thus rule switch
# column 5 : name of the task 
# column 6 : stimulus description
